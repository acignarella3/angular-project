# Angular 4 Project

This is my implementation of the project provided and outlined in the course "Angular 4 (formerly Angular 2) - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. Feel free to click [here](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/overview) to access the course.

This project consists of two pages: a list of modifiable recipes, and a shopping list of ingredients that can be added by name and quantity. It has been created entirely with Angular 4 and the Angular CLI, and is meant to demonstrate my growing efficiency in the framework.

This project currently represents up to Section 10 in the course.
